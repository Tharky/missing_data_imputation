# Imputation Methods for Missing Data

This is a basic python code to read a dataset, find missing data and apply imputation methods to try to recover some data with some error.

## About

There are 4 imputation methods used in this code (available to select within the runtime of the code):
* [Least Squares Data Imputation](#least-squares-data-imputation)
* [Naive Bayes Imputation](#naive-bayes-imputation)
* [Hot Deck Imputation](#hot-deck-imputation)
* [Imputation with Most Frequent Element](#imputation-with-most-frequent-element)

## Methods

### Least Squares Data Imputation
This method imputes the missing data with least squares formula and rewrites the data.
```python
if stuff:
    x = True
```
### Naive Bayes Imputation
This method is awesome as hell.
### Hot Deck Imputation
Oh my god look at this superb method.
### Imputation with Most Frequent Element
Wow this method is extraordinary.
